# Digital-Media-Store-Sales-Analysis
This project is centered on analyzing a relational database storing a digital media store's product, customer, employee, and transaction information. Relevant information will be queried from the database and visualized in order to answer the following questions:
- Which albums should be purchased in the future to retain or improve sales?
- Which employees generate the most sales? How does this compare to other employees?
- Which countries have the most potential for growth in sales?
- Do more customers purchase whole albums, or collections of one or more individual tracks?

### Results
- Rock albums make up more than 50% of individual sales.
- International marketing campaigns should be focused on the Czech Republic, India, and the UK since these countries have the most potential for increased sales per customer.
- 81% of customer transactions consist of a collection of individual track purchases, rather than whole album purchases.

### Libraries used
